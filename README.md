# Bondora-loan-prediction


## Project description

Bondora offers different ways for investors to invest. The easiest way is to use Bondora's Go & Grow service or just set up their portfolio based on risk levels. For some investors these methods are great as they require minimal user input. However the downside is that by using those methods the investor has no control over the loans that they receive. So the solution is to use Bondora's API as it provides investors full control over the loans they can purchase on the primary and secondary market.

The scope of this project is not to create an application that uses Bondora's API to invest. Instead we will work with Bondora's publicly available dataset and create a model that is capable of accurately predicting loan outcomes that can later be used in such applications. This model can be later used in such applications for automated investing in the primary and/or secondary market.
